This guide helps maintainers effectively onboard and support new contributors to the LIBR project.

## 🎯 Quick Overview

We've made LIBR beginner-friendly with:
- **Simplified issue/PR templates** with emojis and clear language
- **Beginner Guide** with step-by-step instructions
- **Automated tools** for commit message validation
- **Setup script** for quick project setup
- **Clear project structure** under `src/` directory

## 📋 Maintainer Checklist for New Contributors

### When Someone Shows Interest:

1. **Welcome them warmly** - Remember, everyone was new once!
2. **Point them to resources**:
   - [Beginner Guide](BEGINNER_GUIDE.md)
   - `good first issue` labeled issues
   - Setup script: `./scripts/setup.sh`

3. **Suggest appropriate tasks** based on their background:
   - **Beginners**: Documentation, UI improvements, simple bug fixes
   - **Web developers**: `src/web-client/` (React/TypeScript)
   - **Mobile developers**: `src/mobile-client/` (Flutter)
   - **Backend developers**: `src/core-protocol/` or `src/network/` (Go)
   - **Blockchain developers**: `src/contracts/` (Solidity)

### When Reviewing First PRs:

1. **Be extra patient and helpful**
2. **Focus on encouragement** - praise what they did well
3. **Provide specific, actionable feedback**
4. **Link to relevant documentation** when requesting changes
5. **Explain the "why" behind your suggestions**

### Common New Contributor Issues & Solutions:

#### ❌ Wrong Commit Message Format
**Instead of:** "Please fix your commit message"
**Say:** "Great work! Let's fix the commit message format. Run `./scripts/validate-commit.sh \"feat: your description\"` to check the format. Here's what yours should look like: `feat: add login button`"

#### ❌ Missing Tests
**Instead of:** "Add tests"
**Say:** "This looks good! Could you add a simple test for this feature? Check the existing tests in the same directory for examples, or ask if you need help writing tests."

#### ❌ Not Following Project Structure
**Instead of:** "Wrong directory"
**Say:** "Thanks for the contribution! This code should go in `src/web-client/` since it's React code. Check our [project structure guide](README.md#project-structure) for reference."

## 🏷️ Issue Labeling for Beginners

Use these labels to help newcomers find appropriate tasks:

- `good first issue` - Perfect for newcomers
- `beginner-friendly` - Suitable for those with some experience
- `documentation` - Writing/updating docs
- `frontend` - UI/UX work
- `backend` - Server-side logic
- `mobile` - Mobile app development
- `help wanted` - Extra attention needed

## 🔧 Tools for Maintainers

### Quick Commands:
```bash
# Check if someone's commit message is correct
./scripts/validate-commit.sh "their commit message"

# Set up the project quickly
./scripts/setup.sh
```
